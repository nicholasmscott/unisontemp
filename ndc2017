Developing An Organising Branch","content":"<p>Conference recognises the increasingly hostile environment in which UNISON branches are operating. Austerity cuts have reduced the number of activists and put further pressure on facility time; while increased fragmentation of the workforce has made organising more difficult. Meanwhile the need for us to develop an organising approach has never been greater.<\/p>\n<p>There is no one single model for an effective organising branch and Conference welcomes the various initiatives that branches, regions and the centre have taken to develop an organising approach, including the development of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New branch structures including mergers and arrangements for joint branch working;<\/li>\n<li>Shop Front organising facilities;<\/li>\n<li>Digital support for organising;<\/li>\n<li>Advice on and support for facility time agreements;<\/li>\n<li>The use of Fighting Fund Organisers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The challenge facing branches is that with all the other pressures activists often find it difficult to make time for organising, as other competing priorities crowd out organising work.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that one way of overcoming this barrier is for branches to agree to establish an organising working group made up of activists solely focused on organising. Their remit will include developing an organising plan as part of the Joint Branch Assessment process, which they will then help implement.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the plan should specify how the organising working group members will help:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase recruitment so that UNISON is stronger in the workplace;<\/li>\n<li>Develop new activists, to improve communications between UNISON, the members and the employers;<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that new activists are trained and supported, with the aim, wherever possible, of getting an activist in each workplace;<\/li>\n<li>Reach out to workers in the fragmented workforce;<\/li>\n<li>To encourage democratic participation in UNISON by members through the democratic structures and Self Organised Groups.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Conference therefore calls on regions and branches to develop this approach to help branches deal with the challenges we face.<\/p>\n<p>Conference also calls on the National Executive Council to ensure that a suite of materials and training is developed to support this approach.<\/p>\n<p>In light of the increasingly serious challenges faced by branches, Conference calls on the National Executive Council to produce a paper before next year\u2019s National Delegate Conference setting out the various options available to branches to deal with the fragmented workforce and increasing pressure on activists.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add at end of first paragraph:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This organising approach cannot be focused simply at branch level.

Organising and growing our membership in private contractors","content":"<p>Conference notes that despite UNISON\u2019s necessary and continued campaigns against privatisation, the outsourcing of public services continues apace. Conference completely condemns this Tory government\u2019s relentless attack on the public sector and continues to call on the government to properly fund publically delivered services. However, whilst privatisation remains a reality, conference also recognises that the union must continue to organise and grow our membership in private contractors. Conference also notes that not all our membership in the private sector has come via TUPE from the public sector. Many of our members have never worked for a public employer or work in areas of private sector growth, like social care.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes last year\u2019s rule change to establish the new National Private Contractors Forum. This forum is giving our private contractor members a real voice in UNISON and a route to engage in the democratic structures of the union. This is a unique opportunity for the union to reach out into our membership in private companies, building our power and our ability to protect these workers.<\/p>\n<p>In order to make these new structures a success at all levels, the union must pull together; focusing on building capacity and activism. We recognise the huge challenges the fragmented and outsourced workforce places on branches and resources, including attacks on facility time that make our reps\u2019 job even harder. However the union must support our reps in private contractors, and recruit and train more. Conference notes the good work that has been done so far:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regional heads of private contractors in every region;<\/li>\n<li>A new annual national training seminar for private contractor reps;<\/li>\n<li>A new National Private Contractor Forum and several company forums.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In order to further our good work and to build our strength in private contractors, conference therefore calls on the National Executive Council to continue to prioritise the union\u2019s activity private contractors and to work with:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Regions to:<\/li>\n<li>Continue to prioritise organising in private contractors and to allocate resources;<\/li>\n<li>To map their private contractor membership to identify on regional targets for organising (linking with the national organising targets where appropriate);<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and develop activists to populate and engage with the national company forums and National Private Contractors Forum;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Work with branches to look at how best to group and allocate private sector members, including new models of organisation where appropriate;<\/li>\n<li>Focus on supporting branches and members to gain recognition in private employers.<\/li>\n<li>Branches to:<\/li>\n<li>Identify, through the Joint Branch Assessment, key private contractors in their branch where there is the opportunity for organising and activist development;<\/li>\n<li>Where possible, nominate a member of the branch executive to have strategic oversight of the fragmented workforce in their branch;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage in procurement processes to put pressure on tendering bodies to include priorities like the living wage and union recognition as conditions of transfer;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Support their members in the private sectors to attend and engage with the private company forums and relevant regional structures.<\/li>\n<li>The Private Contractors Unit to:<\/li>\n<li>Prioritise increasing the number of companies we have national recognition with or a national relationship with;<\/li>\n<li>Work with all parts of the union to continue the campaign against insecure work and zero hours contracts, a real problem for workers in the private sector;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Work with the Learning and Organising Services team to develop a programme of training for activists in private companies that is both relevant and accessible;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Work with the Strategic Organising Unit to identify and promote a cross-section of examples of good practice in private contractor membership organisation and organising strategies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><em>Private Contractors National Forum<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In &#8220;b) Branches to:&#8221; insert new action point iii):<\/p>\n<p>\u201ciii) Engage with commissioners to lobby for a return of services to in-house provision;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Renumber subsequent points.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Under &#8220;b) Branches&#8221; add new iv):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;iv) Use procurement processes to engage with employers on ethical procurement codes and policies and compliance with the Modern Slavery Act to ensure there are no abuses in the employer\u2019s global supply chain&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Renumber points.<\/p>\n<p>Under &#8220;c) The Private Contractors Unit&#8221; add new point v):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;v) Work to develop and promote good practice in ethical procurement so that members can engage with their employers on the ethical dimensions of procurement.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>United Utilities<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>2.3<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the third paragraph insert new sentence after \u201cmore\u201d:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Private Contractor representatives need to be an integral part of branch structures and require support from branch officers and regional staff.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the fourth paragraph insert the word \u201cwithin\u201d between \u201cactivity\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In bullet point b) insert new iv):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;iv) Actively recruit, train and support reps from within the private contractor workforce&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Renumber accordingly.<\/p>\n"},{"id":"6814","type":"about-section","title":"3. An organising strategy for the Social Care workforce","content":"<p>Social care plays a vital and growing role in our society. Yet increasing demand, falling real terms funding, and increasingly complex care needs has put the sector under significant strain.<\/p>\n<p>Social Care workers are often the people who are at the sharp end following cuts in public services elsewhere \u2013 dealing with clients who cannot be admitted to hospital, or are discharged too soon, who are at home waiting for care assessments.<\/p>\n<p>Most care workers are highly committed to the work they do, but such conditions are putting them under significant strain. If we want a social care system that can meet the needs of our ageing population and treat recipients in a dignified way, then we need to invest in the workforce that provides it.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes the work done in Scotland by trade unions, working with the Scottish Government, to develop a \u2018Fair Work\u2019 agenda which has included a commitment to pay the Living Wage to all workers providing social care and ensure that a range of workforce matters are included in procurement.<\/p>\n<p>Conference applauds the work around the Ethical Care Charter and welcomes the decisions of councils to sign up to it.<\/p>\n<p>Conference recognises that social care workers are an under pressure and growing section of the public service workforce. Conference acknowledges that there are significant challenges to organising this group of workers; they are often widely scattered, or lone workers and they may be subject to zero or nominal hour\u2019s contracts. Workers doing the same job, for the same contracting authority, may be divided amongst several employers on widely varying terms and conditions. Many will also be required to meet stringent regulatory standards for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>Conference therefore calls upon the National Executive Council to develop a specific organising strategy for the social care workforce. This should consist of a recruitment strategy aimed at increasing UNISON\u2019s presence amongst social care workers and a learning and organising strategy aimed at supporting members in expanding roles and in meeting regulatory requirements.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Scotland Region<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>3.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After paragraph \u201cConference welcomes the work done in Scotland by trade unions&#8230;.\u201d add:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConference further welcomes the \u201cCare Workers for Change\u201d organising initiative in the North West which is growing UNISON density and activity in the sector through the campaign for fair funding, decent jobs and quality services.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After paragraph &#8220;Conference therefore calls upon the National Executive Council&#8230;&#8221; add:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAny strategy must recognise the anti-union hostility of many large commercialised providers and include a campaign for public sector commissioners to ensure trade union access and employer neutrality towards union organisation as an objective in considering all future social care contracts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>North West Region<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6827","type":"about-section","title":"4. Organising in homecare","content":"<p>Working conditions in any sector in the UK, with widespread abuse of zero-hour contracts, breaches of minimum wage legislation, and non-payment of the time spent travelling between domiciliary care visits.<\/p>\n<p>Conference recognises the work done by UNISON at all levels to highlight these issues and develop strategies to address them. Conference applauds the work of branches, regions, and our national local government, legal and press teams in experimenting with different organising models, and putting pressure on councils and providers to adopt UNISON\u2019s Ethical Care Charter. But given our low membership density in this sector, the significant barriers to unionisation and the scale of the exploitation, conference believes we must find ways to extend and consolidate this work.<\/p>\n<p>Conference notes that the care sector sustains itself on the goodwill of a workforce that is composed overwhelmingly of women, and disproportionately of Black women. Conference notes that the BBC has reported several instances of Black women care workers in Haringey branch being paid an hourly rate of \u00a33.27. Conference stands in solidarity with this workforce and denounces our current government and the employers concerned for their callous and outrageous disregard.<\/p>\n<p>Conference recognises that the vulnerability of a workforce overwhelmingly employed on zero-hour contracts demands a nuanced and multifaceted organising approach. Conference believes that we must develop unified and complementary industrial, political and legal strategies if we are to decisively challenge the balance of power in the care sector.<\/p>\n<p>Conference appreciates that in a time of public sector cuts, homecare is one of the few sectors in which the workforce has grown due to demographic change and the UK\u2019s ageing population. We recognise that the issues faced by care workers will not go away until we extend nationally our efforts to organise, unify and build power within the workforce.<\/p>\n<p>Conference reaffirms its belief that homecare is best provided by public bodies, where it is subject to proper democratic oversight and accountability. However Conference recognises that the sector is currently dominated by private commissioning models, and therefore that we must challenge problems within these commissioning models at the same time as we challenge outsourcing itself.<\/p>\n<p>Conference instructs the National Executive Council to conduct a comprehensive review of the campaigns and projects UNISON is currently engaged in within the homecare sector. This review is to involve consultation with branches, regions and the national office to share experience and develop best practice for extending our organising efforts in this area, including ways to complement industrial organisation with political and legal approaches.<\/p>\n<p>Conference instructs the National Executive Council to review its organising strategy for the homecare sector and to explore how this may be better resourced.<\/p>\n<p>Conference reaffirms its commitment to the Ethical Care Charter, and instructs the National Executive Council to review the materials available to branches and regions on its implementation. This review will compare its adoption in different local authorities with a view to drawing up a model implementation plan to be made available to branches and regions for negotiations.<\/p>\n<p>Conference instructs the National Executive Council to provide up-to-date bargaining guidance to branches on outsourcing and commissioning models in social care, including help with identifying potential issues and legal claims.<\/p>\n<p>Conference instructs the National Executive Council to consult with regions, branches and self organised groups in a review of subscription banding arrangements for low-paid members on zero-hour contracts, where low and unpredictable incomes can put workers off joining UNISON, and if appropriate to bring forward rule change proposals to National Delegate Conference 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls upon branches to use their initiative in organising care workers in their areas. Conference recognises that some branches do not have the capacity currently to deal with additional private sector casework, and therefore instructs the National Executive Council to provide branches with up-to-date guidance on options to resource such projects.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls upon the Labour Link Committee to put pressure on the Labour Party to adopt UNISON\u2019s Ethical Care Charter as national policy, and to introduce it in general and local elections.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Haringey UNISON Local Government (M)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT AND AMEND<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>4.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Insert a new paragraph after sixth paragraph (currently ending \u2018. . . as we challenge outsourcing itself\u2019):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Conference recognises that the current privatised model of social care has undermined care standards for those reliant on it as well as undermining pay and conditions for the sector\u2019s workforce.

Last year, with the help of Mind Cymru and Time to Change Wales, Cymru\/Wales Disabled Self Organised Group launched their mental health awareness training. They\u00a0 have developed a mental health champions training programme for members and the first champions graduated in April. Participants completed a two day training course designed by the self-organised group and it was run with the assistance of a mental health practitioner. The training gave members the confidence and skills needed to undertake this new role as they help colleagues with mental health problems by directing them to the best available help and support. The feedback has been fantastic.<\/p>\n<p>Mental health problems are much more widespread than people think. One in four people will experience them at some stage in their life, so it is extremely likely that a family member or close colleague at work has been affected. Yet unfortunately, mental health is still surrounded by prejudice, ignorance and fear. The stigma can lead to isolation and exclusion, making it more difficult to recover. This is no way to deal with something that is so common and the truth is that mental well-being is not taken as seriously as physical well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Mental health related problems are frequently caused by difficult situations in the workplace. We know that UK Conservative Government\u2019s austerity cuts directly lead to very high levels of anxiety for those who lose their jobs and for those remaining, who face the pressure of being forced to do a lot more work with fewer resources.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls upon the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage other regions within UNISON to consider taking forward this initiative and develop similar schemes in their regions;<\/li>\n<li>Seek to encourage an interest in good mental health by education and publicity, particularly in UNISON publications, e.g. &#8216;U&#8217; and &#8216;Focus&#8217; magazines and the UNISON website;<\/li>\n<li>Work with Labour Link to draw attention to MPs and members of devolved governments the need to fund good mental health services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>National Disabled Members Committee<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6850","type":"about-section","title":"14.

As a union with over one million members, this is an issue we cannot overlook.<\/p>\n<p>Mental health issues can affect people in many different ways, including barriers to understanding, social anxiety and low self-esteem.

Furthermore, the HSE Management Standards approach comprises of a staff survey, and then focus group discussion of the results leading to action plans to address the issues identified. It recognises that the solutions need to come from the very people it affects.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further notes that full branch involvement in the process can significantly improve the effectiveness of this approach. Where the branch is fully involved, then the survey is undertaken by the branch, and it can be carried out on the basis of confidentiality rather than anonymity.

When local governments allow pensions to be exposed to fossil fuels, they are relying on stranded assets for the safe retirement of their workers.<\/p>\n<p>As continued investments in fossil fuels pose material financial risks to portfolios, funds have fiduciary duties to consider the benefits of decarbonising as part of their investment strategies. Furthermore, trustees may consider non-financial factors if members share the concern and there is no risk of significant financial detriment to the fund \u2013 which is increasingly the case for divestment.<\/p>\n<p>By divesting the \u00a314 billion currently invested in fossil fuels, local councils can take an important step forwards in challenging climate change. Reinvesting this money into renewables, housing and public transport is a feasible and sensible strategy for providing a long term return and building safe pensions for public sector workers.<\/p>\n<p>As well as providing safer long term returns for pensions, all of these would create local jobs, improve the lives of local residents and boost local economies more than investing into multinational fossil fuel companies.<\/p>\n<p>Conference agrees to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaign for divestment from fossil fuel extraction for all pension funds where we have members and we can argue it is in the fiduciary interests of scheme members;<\/li>\n<li>Seek alliances amongst other trade unions who share our objective and work co operatively with them to achieve divestment;<\/li>\n<li>Engage with UNISON members with an aim of improving their knowledge base around climate threats created by fossil fuel extraction;<\/li>\n<li>Produce literature that will enable branches to engage with the employers where they are members of a LGPF.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Scotland Region<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT AND AMEND<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>22.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Insert new sixth paragraph:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConference notes that UNISON is the largest staff union in the UK gas industry and welcomes attempts by the UNISON energy service group executive to investigate hydrogen with carbon capture storage (CCS) as an alternative to gas in the UK&#8217;s supply and distribution pipe network to UK households.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>22.2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Insert new eighth paragraph:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConference notes fiduciary duty is defined by the Law Commission as \u2018ensuring that pensions can be paid, ensuring that this is undertaken at the best possible value\u2019.

Defined benefit pension schemes that guarantee pensions based on final salary or career average are under threat and many in the Education and Energy sectors have closed to new entrants and some have closed to current members as the scheme has closed, and there is no future pension accrual, and many schemes that remain open are increasing member contributions and reducing pension benefits and the way future pension is calculated.<\/p>\n<p>The main reason employers give is high costs and risk of further increases of providing the benefits leading to increased employer contributions.<\/p>\n<p>Even in the public sector certain employers are also looking at ways to reduce pension costs.\u00a0 In some cases by tempting members to leave the schemes by offering pay increases. Another tactic is to transfer services to arms length companies that then try to exclude new starters from the Public Sector Schemes.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why costs are increasing but by far the most damaging is the assumptions the Schemes and their Actuaries are using to value the future growth of their funds.<\/p>\n<p>For example, many funds base future growth assumptions on the likely increase in Gilts. Yields have in this area been artificially low since the last recession so basing returns just on Gilts increases the cost of pension benefits.<\/p>\n<p>We believe a better method would be to base it on the potential growth of the actual assets of the fund. For example if the LGPS England and Wales funds had all used central government assumption on future growth in 2013, the past service deficit of \u00a346 billion could have been halved and employer contributions reduced and that could have led to less cuts in services and jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes the commissioning of independent actuarial advice to help branch negotiations in the private sector to improve Pension settlements for members.

The crisis in Social Care, the underfunding of our NHS and decimation of our Community Care services, all combine to create a perfect storm.<\/p>\n<p>The scale of the problems now faced by adult social care providers are enormous, and are the direct result of massive Government cuts to funding. The National Care Association has said that we are now beyond the crisis point and are now on the edge of a cliff.<\/p>\n<p>A survey by UNISON found that 65 per cent of homecare, residential support and day services staff said they has less time to spend with those they care for because of staff shortages and 36 per cent said rationing of supplies had increased as a result of budget cuts.<\/p>\n<p>The Local Government Association estimates that the gap in social care funding will be at least \u00a32.6 billion unless the Government urgently injects more cash into the service.<\/p>\n<p>Raising Council Tax will not be enough to solve the problems and will only place the lowest paid under even more financial pressure. Net Social Care expenditure has dropped in real terms from \u00a38.1 billion in 2005-6 to \u00a36.3 billion, a drop of a fifth. This is further exacerbated by the national shortage of community health care workers and nurses creating gaps in the services to our most vulnerable citizens.<\/p>\n<p>Recruiting and retaining staff is crucial to our NHS and the campaign of denigration and vilification of the NHS by Government Ministers combined with years of pay cuts and a lack of real terms pay increases has led to a situation where staff are leaving the NHS and critical posts in our emergency departments cannot be filled.<\/p>\n<p>As our underfunded hospitals struggle to function because of further Government cuts, they are faced with having nowhere to send elderly patients when their treatment is complete. They cannot find beds in the hospitals but they also cannot discharge them to the community as the services are not there to support them.<\/p>\n<p>This leads to a crisis situation as beds are blocked and people are forced to stay in hospital. It is creating an intolerable vicious circle and only a clear policy of properly funding social care and health services together with a coherent plan for the integration will begin to address this crisis.<\/p>\n<p>Conference therefore resolves to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaign for properly and adequately funded Health and Social Care Services;<\/li>\n<li>Promote and publicise within our national, regional and local press and media our NHS and Social Care Champions;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to oppose cuts to jobs and services within Health and Social Care.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Yorkshire &#8211; Humberside Region<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>30.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add new point 4):<\/p>\n<p>\u201c4) Conference agrees to affiliate to \u2018Health Campaigns Together\u2019 which organised the massive demo in defence of the NHS on 4 March 2017.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Hackney Local Government (M)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6886","type":"about-section","title":"31.

We agree to support national campaigns on this and campaigns to defend local access to hospital services until new, superior, alternative evidence-based services are developed, properly staffed and funded, that ensure safe and improved services for patients.<\/p>\n<p>Conference also supports the TUC campaign for an end to the seven years of real terms funding freeze that is squeezing the life out of our NHS, reducing performance on key services, and undermining public confidence in the NHS \u2013 with the threat of four more years to come. Conference calls for funding to be increased immediately from the current disastrous level with further increases year by year towards the levels of comparable European and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and for an end to the waste of billions on a competitive market system.<\/p>\n<p>While endorsing the aspiration to greater integration of health and social care for the benefit of patients, UNISON notes that the application of means-tested charges for social care, the extent of the enforced cutbacks in budgets and raised eligibility thresholds, coupled with the fragmentation and privatisation of most domiciliary care and the private ownership of nursing homes prevents integration with an NHS that is still funded through general taxation and free at point of use.<\/p>\n<p>Although in principle we welcome NHS England\u2019s moves to reverse, or in some cases override the Lansley Health and Social Care Act, restore strategic planning and develop a fresh collaboration between competing trusts, UNISON notes that the Act remains in place. As a result many irresponsible Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), not least in Staffordshire, are continuing to contract out services, some awarding fresh contracts to Virgin and other private sector providers even as other contracts end in failure. STPs do not reverse the Act, and cannot eradicate the divisive market system deepened in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>UNISON therefore will work and campaign for new legislation, such as the NHS Reinstatement Bill, that is promoted in the Commons by Margaret Greenwood MP, to reverse the 2012 Act, dismantle the costly and wasteful NHS market system, and restore the NHS as a service publicly financed, publicly owned and publicly provided.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Colchester Health<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6907","type":"about-section","title":"34.

All have failed.<\/p>\n<p>Home ownership is on a downwards spiral, increasingly numbers of people in work are reliant on housing benefit and the number of social housing homes available shrinks year by year.<\/p>\n<p>The chief reason for this housing failure is that there is no long a political consensus in the UK on the need for direct investment and subsidy in public housing.<\/p>\n<p>From 1945 to the 1970&#8217;s political parties of all kinds used to compete on how many affordable homes they could build each year.<\/p>\n<p>This was because there was a widespread consensus that it was the duty of the state to ensure that everyone was securely and safely housed.<\/p>\n<p>In order to build homes we must rebuild this consensus.<\/p>\n<p>Conference resolves to call upon the National Executive Council to campaign with other unions and residents to restore direct investment in public housing.

Not only must the union counter the strong headwinds and continue to make the arguments for an alternative to the cuts and underinvestment that have characterised the austerity decade. We must also use our member\u2019s experiences, campaign resources, evidence and expertise to win over wider public opinion for an alternative that properly recognises the value of properly funded public services to all of our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Conference should acknowledge that winning over public opinion is a huge challenge. Although polls show strong support for the NHS, recent indications suggest that the Tories, responsible for austerity in the first place, enjoy high levels of trust as the party best suited to manage the challenges it faces. Added to this, all too often we see a dispiriting low level of concern about the pressures facing local government and public services more widely.<\/p>\n<p>The UNISON public service champions campaign, launched following support for motion 26 at National Delegate Conference 2016, seeks to help address the challenge of winning over public opinion. Motion 27 passed also set out a strong anti-privatisation agenda to follow too.

Media Portrayal of Older People","content":"<p>Conference notes with concern the negative and profoundly damaging images of older people, both as individuals and collectively, that are continually and consistently put out by the mass media in Britain. This includes portrayal of the age group as having access to large pensions, doing little that is worthwhile and at the same time being a drain on society\u2019s resources and a burden on younger generations. The media and politicians have whipped up a \u201cphoney war\u201d between young and old implying that pensioners have escaped the worst impacts of the austerity measures at the expense of the younger generation.<\/p>\n<p>This attitude is illustrated by the following statement issued by the Work and Pensions Select Committee to launch its inquiry into intergenerational fairness: \u201cthe current generation of people in or approaching retirement will over the course of their lifetimes have enjoyed and accumulated much more housing and financial wealth, public service usage, and welfare and pension entitlements than more recent generations can hope to receive\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>During the past year, elements of the media seem aggressively intent on portraying older people in a negative manner, claiming that hard-won benefits such as free prescriptions, winter fuel allowance and bus passes give pensioners an undeserved privileged position in society. The implication is that some of them should be withdrawn. In truth we know that for many, such benefits make the difference between a frugal lifestyle and one of poverty.<\/p>\n<p>Conference does not believe that pensioners have escaped austerity and notes the following facts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost 40% of those aged 65 and over in the UK experienced poverty at least once between 2010 and 2013, compared with around 30% of those under 65;<\/li>\n<li>42% of older people in the UK said they have struggled to afford essential items such as food, gas, electricity;<\/li>\n<li>Cuts to adult social care budgets mean that 1.5 million older people in England have care and support needs that the state does not meet and either have to fund themselves or go without;<\/li>\n<li>Meals on wheels services have been reduced over the last five years from 300,000 to just 109,000. At the same time, the average price of a meal has increased by 22% and malnutrition among older people costs the NHS an estimated \u00a313 billion a year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Far from enjoying gold plated pensions and untold wealth, millions are living in poverty or fear of poverty. Services on which the majority of older people disproportionately rely have been cut or are under threat. Pensions and benefits have so declined in value that even basic needs cannot be met and thousands die each winter from cold related causes. At the same time the contribution of unpaid labour by older people is a vital part of the bedrock of society without which families and communities could not survive.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, comparing a pension to a benefit drives retirees &#8216;up the wall&#8217; as they have worked all their life for it, said Steve Webb when he was the Pensions Minister in 2014. He also said that people earn their state pension throughout their working lives by paying their national insurance contributions and feel &#8220;stigmatised&#8221; by the idea they are claiming benefits. In 2016 nothing has changed much, where both the government and news media still fail to recognise the fact that most of today\u2019s pensioners are receiving a return on their investment in the state and not some form of hand-out, and continue to portray those in receipt of pensioner entitlements in much the same way as other traditional benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Quite often the media seeks to draw an unfair comparison between pensioner entitlements and the wider working community, failing to recognise the many years of hard work put in by most of today\u2019s pensioners to earn the right to receive a decent pension, concessionary travel and free prescriptions.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is concerned that the myths about wealthy pensioners immune to the effects of the austerity measures will be used to attack the universal benefits which improve the quality of life for many older people.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that the myths must be challenged at every opportunity. In reality, means-testing the winter fuel allowance would have little impact on intergenerational inequality; and there has never been any data to show that 18 year olds are demanding that their grandparents\u2019 bus passes or winter fuel allowances should be taken away.<\/p>\n<p>Maligning pensioners has become a media habit and Conference needs to combat this attitude urgently. We are in a difficult position in that we can\u2019t withdraw our labour to make the point but we can counter the attacks by stating the truth. Many of us have been in paid employment for many years, perhaps raised a family and maybe engaged in house purchase. During this time, we have fully met our obligations to the tax system and indeed continue to do so. Who are these people supposedly deprived by us avaricious pensioners? Is it our families, those we most value and support? Are they complaining about us being given more than our share?\u00a0 Of course they are not. They, like us, know it for the nonsense it is.<\/p>\n<p>Also, Conference welcomes the Trades Union Congress publication, \u201cYoung against Old? What\u2019s really causing Wealth Inequality?\u201d which argues that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The principal factors leading to wealth inequality are housing tenure, geography and earnings, not age. The wealthiest households are mainly of working age, not pensioners, and there is no good reason to target pensioners in order to increase support for young people;<\/li>\n<li>Means-testing or reducing public spending on older people would have little impact on young people\u2019s long-term prospects; and,<\/li>\n<li>The main factors influencing whether young and middle aged people can accumulate wealth through property and pensions are wage levels, job security and housing tenure not public spending.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The truth as stated earlier this year in the excellent National Pensioners Convention submission to the Works and Pensions Select Committee is that the contribution made by pensioners to our society every year vastly exceeds the cost of pensioner benefits by billions of pounds.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is alarmed at the impact of this coverage which creates discord between generations, builds resentment and hostility and promotes and supports discrimination against and exploitation of older people. It significantly increases their vulnerability, leaving them open to abuse by family and strangers. It derecognises the potential of their energy, knowledge, skills and wisdom from which society could so much benefit.<\/p>\n<p>Further, older people are characterised as being \u201cbehind the times\u201d, unable and unwilling to communicate through modern technologies and hence as being in a large measure responsible for their own isolation. They are disproportionately depicted as victims and objects of pity. Their economic, social and cultural contribution to society, past and present, is largely ignored. They are under-represented as authors, experts and contributors to the public arena. Older women LGBT people and Black people are particularly vulnerable both to negative imagery and \u201cinvisibility\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Conference urges the National Executive Council\u00a0 to campaign vigorously with the government and news media to change the way pensions and other entitlements are promoted and reported to the general public. It calls on the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Work closely with the National Pensioners Convention, Trades Union Congress, Scottish Trades Union Congress, Scottish Pensioners Forum, other trades unions and relevant organisations to gain support for a campaign seeking to ensure that positive and diverse images of older people are maintained and strengthened in our union, the wider labour movement and in society;<\/li>\n<li>Urgently organise a campaign strategy to make our concerns known to the relevant media sources;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the TUC publication \u201cYoung against Old?\u201d widely available; use the electronic replacement for Interactive to promote it; ensure its main arguments are reflected in the UNISON Charter for Older People, once reprinted; and, seek ways to make common cause with the Young Members\u2019 Organisation on these issues;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Raise the awareness of working and retired members of UNISON of the myths that are peddled by the media, their purpose and divisiveness and how to campaign against them;<\/li>\n<li>Encourage and support all UNISON members and organisations, and particularly its retired members sections, in countering local and national media on ageism and misrepresentation of older people and replacing it with positive coverage;<\/li>\n<li>Work with UNISON\u2019s National Young Members\u2019 Forum to dispel the myths outlined above and to promote intergenerational fairness;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Report progress on a regular basis in UNISON publications and keep regions and branches informed;<\/li>\n<li>Fight to preserve pensioners\u2019 rights for future generations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>National Retired Members&#8217; Committee<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6924","type":"about-section","title":"43.

Such a tax would also mean that the financial sector would fund public services, rather than cuts to public services continuing to pay for the mistakes of the financial sector.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that with the UK\u2019s EU Exit on the horizon, the government has failed to develop a long-term economic plan that will secure the future of the UK economy \u2013 and our public services \u2013 outside of the EU.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further believes that the government has failed to adequately plan for a post-EU Exit economy, and is placing the UK economy \u2013 and public services funded through tax revenues \u2013 in peril by prioritising an exit from the EU single market.<\/p>\n<p>Conference therefore calls upon the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaign for the fair funding of public services \u2013 and an end to punishing austerity &#8211; through progressive taxation and reversing corporation tax cuts;<\/li>\n<li>Ensure the campaign is linked in to UNISON\u2019s wider anti-austerity campaigning for public services in a way understandable to members and the public;<\/li>\n<li>Continue campaigning for an end to the punitive public sector pay cap, and boost collective bargaining as a means of tackling wage inequality and regional pay disparities;<\/li>\n<li>Campaign to oppose the myth that higher taxes are a punishment and encourage people to view taxation as contributions towards the provision of excellent public services for everyone;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to campaign for a Robin Hood Tax on financial transactions;<\/li>\n<li>Campaign for a real living wage across the UK \u2013 and highlight the gap between the real living wage and the government\u2019s artificial living wage;<\/li>\n<li>Campaign for a council and housing association building program, and additional support for public service worker housing schemes;<\/li>\n<li>Explore new models of corporate governance and continue to support the work of TUSO and others using share ownership to take on unethical business practices;<\/li>\n<li>Work with Labour Link and the General Political Fund to develop an economic policy which rejects austerity, but ensures a credible and robust plan for UK Government and the devolved institutions.

The continued freeze in working-age benefit payments will reduce living standards as inflation is predicted to be 2.5-3%. Some households will be especially hard-hit by limiting state support in the tax credit and Universal Credit systems to just two children, reductions in entitlements to Employment and Support Allowance, and the vindictive household benefits cap. Meanwhile, increases in personal tax allowances will cost the Government \u00a32bn with 80% of the gains from this policy going to the richest half of households.

Universal Basic Income","content":"<p>Universal (or Unconditional) Basic Income, also known as Citizen\u2019s Income, is a redistributive policy proposal that has been around for centuries, and is once again making headlines. It was advocated by Martin Luther King, Jr. shortly before his death, among many others.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that every single citizen, as a non-withdrawable right, receives a guaranteed monthly income that is sufficient to cover the basics for survival. Firstly it could almost eradicate urgent poverty. It removes the disincentive to work that can be experienced with traditional welfare systems in which benefits are lost as earnings rise. Removing means-testing would save a huge amount of bureaucracy, errors and non-take-up. Education and health outcomes could improve which would also create savings for society as well as improving people&#8217;s living standards considerably.<\/p>\n<p>In recent months debate around Universal Basic Income (UBI) has exploded and there are now movements pushing for it around the world. Governments in Finland, Netherlands, France, Canada and Brazil are committed to investigating it through pilot studies. Leading think tanks and economists in the UK, the EU and US also believe it to be a necessary direction of travel. There have already been studies and comparable schemes in India, Namibia, Canada and Alaska with exciting results.<\/p>\n<p>UBI would give people dignity, a secure floor to stand on, and relief from stress. It\u2019s simple, fair and unifying \u2013 it ends divisive narratives about who does or doesn\u2019t deserve to eat or have shelter. Many more of us would be able to job share. Our members could find more time and energy to be active in the union, or do other volunteering. The economy gets a kickstart as people have more to spend.<\/p>\n<p>All of the above, plus the potential benefits for young people, for women, for low paid workers, for people struggling to navigate a precarious job market, and for those needing to leave abusive relationships, means that a Universal Basic Income, in principle, would be in the interests of our members and communities.<\/p>\n<p>Conference notes the recent position adopted by the GMB, Unite and the TUC to campaign for UBI, and the intention of the Labour party to look into the policy. Conference also notes that Universal Basic Income was the top reprioritised motion from the West Midlands at National Delegate Conference 2016 and that the West Midlands region has asked the candidates for Regional Mayor to run a trial UBI pilot.<\/p>\n<p>Conference affirms that UNISON supports in principle the introduction of a Universal Basic Income in this country.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important that UNISON\u2019s voice is not overlooked in the growing debate about practicalities and therefore Conference instructs the National Executive Council to begin looking at the idea in more detail, with particular consideration given to the following questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ideal level that a UBI should be set at for it to have a positive impact on poverty, health, work-life balance, equalities and people\u2019s ability to participate in public life;<\/li>\n<li>What complementary policies and services would need to accompany a UBI to ensure that its impact is progressive (noting that there are differing versions of UBI, some of which are supported by those on the political right);<\/li>\n<li>That would be UNISON\u2019s favoured method of funding a UBI, not limited to income tax but including new revenue streams that do not as yet exist?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>West Midlands Region<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT AND AMEND<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>50.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Delete seventh paragraph and replace with:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConference affirms that UNISON has a long tradition of campaigning for a living wage, a decent social security system, collectively provided public services for those according to their needs, progressive taxation and a more equal society.

Private Insurance","content":"<p>UNISON has been a long standing supporter of the NHS not only because of our members who work in the sector but also because of what the NHS represents. The most talented and dedicated people work in the NHS and provide the best care a patient can receive. However the current political debates are increasingly focused entirely on cost which violates the rights of patients.<\/p>\n<p>The Tory policies based on austerity have denied the NHS proper funding and pushed it into a state of crisis which has led to such a shortage of health care that it is now rationed. Waiting lists getting longer routinely deprive patients of crucial, irreplaceable time, and this burden falls hardest on the sickest patients, those with the least time to spare. In some cases, it can cost them their very lives.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes firmly in UNISON\u2019s long held commitment to campaigning to defend our NHS and the rights of patients. To agree a partnership with AIG Europe to offer private health insurance cover for members seems a contradiction of these long held values. The most recent offer to member in this respect is the private health insurance which has been offered as a \u2018benefit\u2019 to women members should they be affected by one of seven cancers with a policy available to women between the ages of 18-69. Conference feels that this is morally wrong; affordable health care is not a commodity in a caring society which we claim to be &#8211; it is a moral imperative.<\/p>\n<p>Health insurance premiums, in an insurance-as-commodity model, cannot be priced affordably. The odds are very high (approaching 100%) that each insured member will have to make a claim, at some point. Therefore, the insurance issuer cannot make a profit unless the premium is high enough to cover all the costs, or if restrictions are applied to reduce the odds that insured members will have to make claims. A combination of the age at which most women are most at risk of developing cancer and the increased costs to the premium as women get older puts this private health insurance financially out of the reach to a large section of our women members especially those who are low paid.<\/p>\n<p>Breast Cancer &#8211; the lifetime risk of a woman developing breast cancer is one in eight. The majority of breast cancers (81%) occur in women over the age of 50.<\/p>\n<p>Ovarian Cancer &#8211; half of all ovarian cancers are found in women 63 years of age or older.<\/p>\n<p>Cervical Cancer &#8211; most likely to affect women aged 25-34, however 20 per cent of new diagnoses and nearly 50 per cent of cervical cancer deaths occur in women over the age of 64.<\/p>\n<p>Uterine Cancer &#8211; most often occurs in women over 50; the average age is 60<\/p>\n<p>Vaginal Cancer \u2013 occurs most often in women between 50 and 70 years old; approximately half of women with vaginal cancer are older than 60.<\/p>\n<p>Vulva Cancer &#8211; most women diagnosed with vulvar cancer are older than 50. However, about 15% of women who develop vulvar cancer are younger than 40.<\/p>\n<p>Fallopian Tube Cancer &#8211; affects women from ages 18-88, with the most common occurrence being between 40 and 65 years old.<\/p>\n<p>The insurance that UNISON is supporting has an incremental cost linked to the age of the woman. So for a woman of 50 the monthly cost would be \u00a333.50\u00a0 (\u00a3402 per year) and by the age of 60 it would rise to \u00a344.55 (\u00a3535 per year), yet evidence pointed out above demonstrates more older women are likely to be affected by cancer, therefore unlikely to benefit from this insurance policy because private insurance companies tend to design policies with the aim of attracting people with lower-than-average health risks and exclude those with higher health risks and this then leads to discrimination and the exclusion of older women.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, many of our women members are in low paid jobs, zero hours contracts, and more public sector workers anxious about the shrinking of the services they provide which puts their employment at risk, should we really be asking women to buy into an insurance policy that is unaffordable for many of them, when it is an added expense many can\u2019t afford. More women work part-time than men which often comes at the expense of low wages, leaving too many women piling debts. By promoting private health insurance UNISON is creating a divide between those who can afford it and those who can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Although private health insurance can increase financial protection to those able to pay, high premiums mean that few women can afford to join, and it cannot benefit therefore more than a limited group of women. Paying for additional health insurance is one thing; paying premiums month after month to keep it is another, a dip in income or unexpected expenses can make that recurring bill unmanageable, and losing coverage is a possibility.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that UNISON must demonstrate its commitment to protecting equal access to health and effective preventative care for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore Conference asks the National Executive Council to work with relevant departments and external agencies to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop policy for future UNISON Living benefits for members which do not contradict the values and principles of our public service union;<\/li>\n<li>Review the uptake by women members as an indication of the viability and requirement for future offers in this field;<\/li>\n<li>Do not actively promote it as a UNISON Living benefit to women members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Southampton District<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SEEK WITHDRAWAL<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"7073","type":"about-section","title":"Rules 1.

Fighting Insecure Work","content":"<p>Conference notes recent TUC research which found that one in ten UK workers, 3.2 million people, work in casual, agency, zero hour contracts or low paid self employment. They, and many more, face job insecurity, in-work poverty and workplace exploitation. This mushrooming shadow economy not only erodes the bargaining power of ordinary workers and degrades people\u2019s expectations of their treatment within the workplace, it has long term implications for the political, economic and social health of the entire country.<\/p>\n<p>Conference notes that the TUC research found that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 million people are now at risk of missing out on family-friendly rights including rights to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave (including the right return to their job after the time off) and the right to request to work flexibly, an increase of 700,000 compared to a decade ago;<\/li>\n<li>In addition, there are 1.7 million self-employed people who lack access to these rights, and whose low pay means they cannot afford to protect themselves against the risk this creates;<\/li>\n<li>5 million may have no right to an itemised pay slip, making it more difficult to receive the correct pay, an increase of 700,000 compared to a decade ago. These 1.5 million may also be missing out on protection from unfair dismissal;<\/li>\n<li>Nearly 500,000 people on a zero-hours contract or in insecure temporary work do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay because they earn less than \u00a3112 a week, nearly a third of all those in this category;<\/li>\n<li>These workers are also excluded from full maternity pay and have no right to paternity pay;<\/li>\n<li>There is also no right for these workers to be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Conference believes that precarious work exacerbates the imbalances of power which is already a feature of workplaces in the UK. Employers are able to define \u2018flexibility\u2019 to their advantage at the cost of an employee\u2019s ability to say no to bad pay and detrimental conditions as well as holding a potent weapon against any challenge in the form of withholding work. There is a general and justified fear amongst agency and zero hours contract workers that if they do not accept work pattern changes that they will get minimal or no hours allocated the following week or month. In the same way they feel they themselves cannot even request changes to schedules for fear of a later drop in hours and hence income. Conference believes that the nature of such work and the wage patterns it produces contributes to the growing inequality in this country.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of working within such exploitative terms and conditions of service can fundamentally reshape people\u2019s experiences of work, lowering expectations and increasing tolerance of bad treatment. Low pay and insecure employment can also lead to debt, increasing the likelihood that once workers become even more vulnerable to low paid, insecure work and less able to challenge bad practices in the workplace, particularly poor health and safety. This has been compounded by the introduction of employment tribunal fees has further removed the ability of workers to tackle bad employers and access workplace justice. Fees have significantly reduced the likelihood of employers facing individual enforcement action. Since the introduction of fees in 2013 in Great Britain there has been a 70 per cent drop in tribunal claims.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that the Government\u2019s approach to the problem of widespread non-compliance with the NMW in the care sector is not fit for purpose. The National Audit Office has reported that up to 220,000 homecare workers in England are illegally paid below the National Minimum Wage. An investigation by Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) of care providers between 2011 and 2013 found that 50% were guilty of non-compliance with the National Minimum Wage. The Resolution Foundation has calculated that care workers are collectively cheated of \u00a3130m a year due to sub minimum pay. Yet since the commencement of naming and shaming of employers by the Department for Business Innovation and Skill in 2014 only 36 separate social care providers have been exposed. Arrears of \u00a386,075 have been identified for a total of just 646 workers. The Government still primarily relies upon care workers ringing the HMRC\u2019s Pay and Rights Helpline before they will investigate care providers for non-compliance. However, many care workers are fearful of reporting their employer in case it jeopardises their employment, as a large proportion are now employed on zero hours contracts. The use of confusing and impenetrable pay slips by care employers is used to help mask non-compliance with the minimum wage and prevents care workers from receiving the pay that they are entitled to. Faced with growing pressure from UNISON to comply with minimum wage laws many care companies are now claiming they cannot afford to pay their workers legally. Conference condemns the actions of these care providers who have exploited their workforce for years.<\/p>\n<p>Conference also notes that the entrenchment of women workers in insecure, low paid, part time work is often treated as a normal feature of the labour market rather than as a continuing injustice. Almost half of UNISON&#8217;s one million women members work part time. Some occupations like hospital domestics and school meals workers, are nearly all part time and are almost exclusively posts occupied by women &#8211; four times as many women than men work part time. Whilst part time work is often the only option for women seeking to balance homecare and childcare commitments with an income, there is, quite literally, a price to be paid, as the gender pay gap for women part time workers is significantly wider than that for full time women workers (as compared to full time men). There is a clear necessity for more quality part time working options. Conference believes that part time workers must have a right to equal pay for work of equal value; equal rights to bonus and other pay enhancements; equal access to fair pensions; and equal access to quality training and promotion.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes the new Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA)\u00a0 and its extended remit for tackling exploitation across the labour market. However, Conference is deeply concerned about a lack of new resources for an expanded remit. The current activities of the existing enforcement agencies are already stretched and there is no indication of additional funding being made available for the new enforcement framework and activities. If additional funding is not made available then resources will be diverted from existing compliance and enforcement work.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that action to tackle the growth of insecure and low paid work cannot rely on individual workers in the most precarious of circumstances raising complaints about their employers. They do so risking their livelihoods and their family\u2019s future and for migrant workers, at the threat of deportation.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls for strong enforcement action, greater coverage of employment rights for all workers and most crucially, strengthened collective bargaining across the labour market. This includes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reforming employment status laws and rules to ensure that all workers benefit from the same basic floor of rights at work;<\/li>\n<li>Measures to ensure that workers in low paid jobs do not lose out on key safeguards when they are unable to work, due to sickness, maternity and paternity leave or in retirement;<\/li>\n<li>Increasing minimum wage enforcement by HMRC;<\/li>\n<li>Increasing access to workplace justice by scrapping employment tribunal fees in Great Britain;<\/li>\n<li>Giving trade unions the right to make formal complaints and trigger minimum wage investigations without naming individual workers;<\/li>\n<li>Proper resourcing and funding for the new GLAA;<\/li>\n<li>Improving health workplace health and safety inspections;<\/li>\n<li>Regulating not just abuses of zero hours or short hours contracts but also measures to ensure that all who want them get a regular hours contract;<\/li>\n<li>Strengthen workplace level bargaining and campaigning to tackle discrimination and workplace injustice;<\/li>\n<li>Promote greater collective bargaining coverage across the labour market;<\/li>\n<li>Meaningful and transparent pay slips for workers in the care sector;<\/li>\n<li>Increased resources for health and safety.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Conference therefore calls upon the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Work with the TUC, STUC, WTUC and ICTU to campaign for a framework of measures to promote collective bargaining, union recognition, clear consultation rights and trade union organising;<\/li>\n<li>Negotiate for public authorities to take responsibility for their procurement practises and to have decent standards for in-house teams and contracted staff;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Influence the Westminster Government, devolved administrations and other workplace regulators to promote effective action and resources for enforcement to tackle labour market exploitation;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Campaign at national, regional and local level to ensure that workers rights are not weakened or undermined when the UK leaves the European Union;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to work with the Institute of Employment Rights, the Campaign for Trade Union Freedom and promote the Manifesto for Labour Law;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to campaign greater levels of compliance with the minimum wage in the care sector, including a push for more transparent pay slips;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaign to ensure that care providers are not allowed to use the funding problems in the social care system as an excuse for continuing to exploit our members and the wider workforce through continued non-compliance with the minimum wage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>53.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Insert new sixth paragraph after \u201c&#8230;exploited their workforce for years.\u201d:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Conference notes with concern that some care providers, who are commissioned by public authorities, are hostile to trade unions, and that this can present a barrier in our efforts to support care workers in pursuing even their legal minimum rights at work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In point ii) after \u201c&#8230;in-house teams and contacted staff.\u201d add the following:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This should include pursuing commitments from public authorities to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A) Better employment and service standards from the organisations they commission services from through, for example, adopting UNISON\u2019s ground-breaking Ethical Care Charter;<\/li>\n<li>B) Explore and utilise their new freedoms resulting from the UK leaving the EU so as to favour local, ethical and\/or public sector organisations in procurement decisions.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><em>Sefton Local Government<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>53.2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add new point iii):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;iii) Work with the international committee on ways to promote ethical procurement practices across all of public services to ensure that no abuses take place in the global supply chains of public bodies and private companies delivering public services;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Renumbered accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>United Utilities<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6951","type":"about-section","title":"54.

The subsequent Pension Act (2011) implemented a much faster timetable for bringing in the changes.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst the equalisation of State Pension Age was necessary to meet equality obligations, the impact of the equalisation and subsequent raise in the State Pension Age is greater on women, who are historically significantly lower paid and more likely to have to rely on their state pension alone.<\/p>\n<p>Further, account has not been sufficiently taken of women\u2019s childcare and caring responsibilities; the greater likelihood of them working part-time; and the qualification period in respect of paid employment which creates another barrier for women who are unable to comply with this requirement and achieve the maximum state pension.<\/p>\n<p>Retirement plans for these women have been shattered with devastating consequences. When this group of women started work they were generally paid much less than men and often excluded from workplace pension schemes. Their generation has benefitted little from the social and legal changes that have improved working women\u2019s lives and yet they are now being asked to shoulder much of the burden of equalisation with men. This change will affect over 2.5 million women suffering huge financial losses whilst not having been given enough notice to make alternative plans for their retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Women who had anticipated an earlier retirement are now facing redundancy as public sector cuts bite.\u00a0 Further, many employers are reluctant to employ older workers, and many women of the \u201csandwich generation\u201d are called on to care for elderly dependants and grandchildren.<\/p>\n<p>The Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) campaign was established to fight the injustice caused to women born on or after 6 April 1951, and for transitional arrangements to be put in place. They do not dispute the need for equalisation of the State Pension Age for men and women.<\/p>\n<p>They have challenged the government who ignored the Turner Commission and SAGA recommendations that between 10 and 15 years notice should be given to women who would be affected by the changes; failed to notify many thousands of women of the changes; and accelerated the timetable without due notice.<\/p>\n<p>UNISON has a long history of campaigning and negotiating for decent state and occupational pensions for our members.

Retirement? What retirement?!","content":"<p>Conference notes that in 1995 the Conservative government included into the Pension Act (1995) provision to raise the pension age of women from 60 to 65 so that it would be in line with men\u2019s retirement age. The Conservative led Coalition government\u2019s Pension Act of 2011, implemented a much faster timetable for bringing in the changes and this has led to hundreds of thousands of women suffering a huge loss of up to \u00a315,000 in lost State Pensions.<\/p>\n<p>Campaigning group WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) have undertaken extensive research in their campaigning efforts to get the current government to re-think the timetable in order to make it a much fairer transition for women affected by the changes. The Conservative government of 1995 completely ignored the recommendations that between 10 to 15 years notice should be given to women who would be affected by the changes. The Conservative government then and now continue to show a blatant disregard for women by ignoring the advice from the Turner Commission and Saga in 1995 to give a notice period to women, sending letters to some of the women to be affected 14 years after the 1995 Pension Act was enacted, and speeding up the original timetable of implementation leaving hundreds of thousands of women out of pocket.<\/p>\n<p>Many women claim that they were only notified about any changes when the coalition government announced the speeding up of the original timetable, whilst some still say they have never received a letter at all. The issue is not about the fact that women and men will retire at the same age; the issue is about the unfairness in which the changes to women\u2019s state pensions are being implemented. One example of this is that women of a similar age could have disproportionately longer to wait for their pension, for example a one year difference in a woman\u2019s date of birth can make an almost three year difference to their state pension age!<\/p>\n<p>Conference recognises the campaigning and negotiating work that UNISON does on behalf of members on pensions. WASPI is a women\u2019s campaign that is generating huge support, from individual people, trade unions and also more recently from employers too. Derbyshire County Council recently added its support to the campaign. As UNISON is the largest public sector union, Conference believes that UNISON could show support by raising awareness of the issues for women and of the WASPI campaign by talking to our member and employers.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls on the National Executive Council to work with relevant UNISON committees, Self-Organised Groups and departments, Labour Link, WASPI, the TUC and any other relevant external agencies to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support the WASPI campaign;<\/li>\n<li>Develop information leaflets and a briefing sheet so that branch Women\u2019s officers and branches can raise awareness of the campaign and encourage support at a local level and in particular with employers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Epsom &amp; Ewell Branch Of Unison<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Isle of Wight LG<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6960","type":"about-section","title":"57.

Protecting Workers In Supply Chains Through Ethical Public Procurement","content":"<p>Conference remembers the events of Aril 2013, when the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh resulted in the deaths of more than 1,130 workers, most of whom were young women. Conference notes with dismay the fact that people had been forced to work in a building they knew to be so unsafe as to be on the verge of collapse. Threats to workers that they would be fired if they did not do their shift forced workers into the building that ended up taking the lives of so many and injuring more than 2,000. Conference commends the National Executive Council for implementing an emergency motion to support workers in the garment industry to campaign for their right to freedom of association. Conference further notes the creation of a fund to support the trade union office of the Bangladesh Revolutionary Garment Workers Federation (BRGWF), and encourages regions and branches to continue to support this initiative.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is aware that Rana Plaza was not the first avoidable disaster to take place in the expanding manufacturing industry of the Asia-Pacific region that supplies products that include garments, electronics and food to UK high street retailers, and possibly the NHS, local government and private companies providing public services. Conference acknowledges that violations of workers\u2019 rights also include denying workers the right to join a trade union.<\/p>\n<p>Conference recognises that precarious work is becoming a growing occurrence across the world as some governments seek to develop their economies at the expense of their workforces. Precarious work include workers being forced to work extremely long hours for very little or no pay, sometimes in very hazardous conditions including unsafe buildings; the growing use of child labour; the absence of proper contracts with agreed wages and conditions; not\u00a0 allowing workers to join unions, and the use of physical and sexual violence against workers. Conference notes that 11% of British business leaders polled through YouGov admitted that it was \u201clikely\u201d modern slavery was playing a part in their supply chains.<\/p>\n<p>Decent work, a key objective of the Strategic Development Goals (SDGs), has been widely downgraded in favour of rapid development as workers are being denied their fundamental rights. The removal of legally-binding rights is becoming more widespread as governments introduce legislation to create more \u2018flexibility\u2019 in the labour market: a euphemism for rolling back hard-won trade union and workers\u2019 rights.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is dismayed to hear that in Bangladesh, despite the promised reforms by the government following the tragic events of Rana Plaza, decent work still eludes the millions of workers in the readymade garment industry. In December 2016, workers went on strike for a wage increase. They were met with police brutality and mass sackings by factory owners. Over 1,600 were sacked, union offices were attacked and 600 workers were charged by the police including 11 trade union leaders who were arrested. One of those arrested was the president of one of UNISON\u2019s partners in Bangladesh, BGIWF. This is despite the assurances of the prime minister that there are now \u2018harmonious industrial relations\u2019 in Bangladesh. Conference applauds the National Executive Council for responding to the crackdown by working with British MPs to raise the issue in the UK parliament on our own government\u2019s responsibilities to ensure there are no abuses in supply chains producing goods destined for the UK.<\/p>\n<p>Conference recognises that there are international treaties and codes in place that must be respected if workers are not to be abused in supply chains of goods destined for use in public services in the UK. These include the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO core labour conventions, Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code and the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Conference notes that some public bodies have developed ethical procurement policies but believes that this needs to be expanded to include all public service providers.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is aware that modern slavery, including forced and bonded labour, is becoming more widespread both in the UK and overseas. It is estimated that as many as 20,000 people are enslaved in the UK. Conference is concerned that the Modern Slavery Act has loopholes that exempt British companies from obligations under the Act if the goods or services they procure are not destined for the UK market. Conference believes this loophole must be closed. Conference further believes that the Modern Slavery Act reporting requirement under section 54 should be extended to include all public bodies.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that UNISON members in all service groups including the NHS, local government, education as well as private companies providing public services have a role to play in ensuring their employers source ethically to ensure there is no exploitation in their supply chains.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls on the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask the International committee to work with service groups to promote UNISON\u2019s ethical procurement policy;<\/li>\n<li>Encourage members to engage with their employers on ethical procurement strategies to ensure that products including clothing, footwear, electronics, food and other goods are ethically sourced;<\/li>\n<li>Support the extension of section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act to include public bodies;<\/li>\n<li>Support campaigns to amend the Modern Slavery Act so that UK companies are held responsible for abuses in their supply chains where goods or services are not destined for the UK e.g. the construction industry in Qatar;<\/li>\n<li>Work with trade unions and non-governmental organisations such as Labour Behind the Label and People and Planet, to support workers making goods destined for the UK market, in their campaigns for fundamental rights at work;<\/li>\n<li>Encourage branches and regions to affiliate to Anti-Slavery International and Labour Behind the Label;<\/li>\n<li>Encourage branches and regions to get involved in the TUC\u2019s Playfair Qatar campaign.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n"},{"id":"6965","type":"about-section","title":"59.

Conference is also concerned that the Green Paper fails to mention partnership working with trade unions and runs contrary to the Prime Ministers threat to change the UK into an offshore tax haven should the EU fail to grant the UK a good deal regarding access to the single market.<\/p>\n<p>Recent campaigns by UNISON and the ETUC on trade agreements such as Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) have highlighted to members how recently negotiated international trade agreements are now mostly about \u201cregulatory barriers\u201d to trade &#8211; not tariffs. TTIP negations have currently stalled and the Trump administration\u2019s decision to walk away from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) mean that TTIP is very unlikely to be agreed, if at all, by the time the UK has left the European Union. However, Conference is extremely worried about reports that the UK Government may seek a fast-track trade deal with the US. Private healthcare companies in the US have an \u2018offensive interest\u2019 in opening up the NHS to further privatisation and multinational pharmaceutical companies want to undermine NHS pricing controls. UNISON also knows that such a move would only lower standards in the UK by abolishing the regulatory controls that exist to protect workers and consumers. UNISON members also known that pay, pensions and other terms and conditions may also be affected in the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, whilst the further privatisation of services through such deals, which history has shown to penalise women workers in particular, may also adversely impact on existing standards.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is also alarmed that international trade deals increasingly include investment protection chapters and investor state dispute settlements. Conference believes that such mechanisms are a direct threat to democratic decision making restricting governments from legislating in the public interest, how they run public services and regulate utilities. These provisions give foreign companies a right to apply to private arbitration tribunals for compensation whenever a government passes a law which they deem to be a form of indirect expropriation of their assets, bypassing national courts and undermining democracy. The tribunal process only benefits those companies that use it and the high paid corporate lawyers that service it whilst, at the same time, threatening the willingness of governments to pass public health, environmental protection or human rights legislation.<\/p>\n<p>UNISON believes that all trade deals and any new Trade Bill regarding future international trade deals must be carefully negotiated, have broad public consultation and be democratically voted on in the UK Parliament and by the devolved nations parliaments and assemblies.<\/p>\n<p>Conference therefore calls on the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Campaign to ensure there is both full Parliamentary and full public consultation on all future trade deals;<\/li>\n<li>Work with other trade unions and external campaigning groups, including those based in other countries, to ensure that future trade agreements between the UK and other countries must include enforceable labour provisions based on the ILO core conventions, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the ILO Decent Work Agenda;<\/li>\n<li>Work with Parliamentarians to ensure that future trade deals explicitly exclude public services, including exclusion from investment chapters and their private tribunals, not just market access and national treatment;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to play a leading role, both in the UK and internationally, in shaping an alternative trade agenda that respects international labour standards and quality public services, protection of the environment and the right of countries in the Global South and elsewhere to set their own priorities for economic development;<\/li>\n<li>Lobby MPs, MEPs and Ministers to highlight the threats posed by new trade deals and to oppose their implementation when they undermine workers rights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>62.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Add at end of penultimate paragraph (ending.. \u201cdevolved nations parliaments and assemblies.\u201d):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Conference believes that Theresa May\u2019s haste in offering a State Visit to Donald Trump is part of an agenda to promote Trade Deals which will not protect workers\u2019 rights or public services.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Add new point 6):<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;6) Support the demand that the offer of a State Visit to Donald Trump is withdrawn.

Conference is concerned that this big business agenda poses a serious threat to jobs, democracy, worker\u2019s rights, public services such as the NHS, and the environment.<\/p>\n<p>A recent research report by UN economic researcher Pierre Kohler and Delft University economist Servaas Storm warns that CETA will reduce employment throughout the trade area, depressing wages in the EU and Canada. The report predicts that CETA will eliminate 227,000 jobs by 2023, with 204,000 job losses across the EU and a further 23,000 jobs lost in Canada. The European Parliament\u2019s own Employment and Social Affairs Committee found that CETA will widen \u2018the income gap between unskilled and skilled workers thus increasing inequalities and social tensions\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Conference is concerned that CETA, along with other international trade deals, contains an investment protection chapter and separate corporate court system that gives corporations powers to sue the UK government. Such a system provides big business with access to a court that is not available to anyone else such as trade unions or citizens and restricts a government\u2019s ability to legislate in the public interest.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that the passage of CETA leaves us with serious concerns about any future trade deals the government negotiates after the UK leaves the European Union.

The disproportionate government response to the coup is clearly intended to silence its critics and goes far wider than the alleged perpetrators.<\/p>\n<p>At least 100,000 public sector employees have been dismissed or suspended arbitrarily, in most cases without evidence of wrong doing. Workers who have been sacked are banned from future employment in the public sector. An estimated 15,000 members of public sector trade union centre KESK unions have been left without jobs, particularly in education and health. Many media outlets critical of the government have been closed down and the journalists who work for them arrested.<\/p>\n<p>The denial of workers\u2019 rights did not start with the coup. For many years trade unionists have been subjected to repressive laws, a flawed legal system, police brutality and a continued erosion of their rights. May Day celebrations have been banned and security forces have brutally crushed trade union protests, arresting trade union leaders, commonly under anti-terror laws or for insulting the president. The ITUC gives Turkey a rating of 5, i.e. no guarantee of rights, in its annual global rights index, placing it amongst the worst countries to be a trade unionist in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Trade unionists in the south east of Turkey have come under particular attack, particularly following the elections in June 2015 and the breakdown of peace talks between the government and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) in July 2015. Thousands of Kurdish teachers have been arbitrarily dismissed for alleged links with the PKK, trade union offices have been raided and activists have been arrested for conducting legitimate trade union business. Escalating violence, curfews and the mass deployment of security forces restricted freedom of movement and authorities prevented residents from leaving their homes to access medical services, food and water. Democratically elected representatives of Kurdish areas have been detained, including MPs representing the People\u2019s Democracy Party (HDP) and local mayors replaced by government appointees.<\/p>\n<p>Conference notes that Turkey is currently hosting three million refugees and asylum seekers, most of whom are escaping the atrocities in Syria. This has placed an immense strain on public services and the government has failed to provide adequate protection and support to refugees and asylum seekers in poverty, facing exploitation. The European Union (EU) has prevented refugees and asylum seekers entering its territory through deals with countries on its borders, erecting fences and denying its responsibility to millions of vulnerable people fleeing conflict, violence and persecution.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that UK government has failed to respond to the erosion of democracy and human rights in Turkey, instead prioritising future trade deals and preventing refugees entering Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Conference denounces Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s call on the EU to stop pushing Turkey \u201cinto a corner\u201d over the death penalty.

Palestine: 50 Years of Occupation","content":"<p>Conference notes that 2017 commemorates the 50th anniversary of the occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, the 10th anniversary of the siege of Gaza and the centenary of the Balfour Declaration. These events continue to have a devastating impact of the lives of 1.9 million people living under siege in Gaza, 2.7 million people in the illegally occupied West Bank and millions of refugees forced from their homes by the conflict.<\/p>\n<p>In the last 50 years the illegal occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem has intensified.\u00a0 About 250 illegal settlements and outposts have been built housing at least 547,000 settlers on over 60 per cent of Palestinian land. Building has increased dramatically in recent years alongside the rapid demolition of Palestinian homes. In 2016 alone the Israeli government destroyed at least 1,089 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank.<\/p>\n<p>For the last decade the Israeli government have blockaded access to Gaza by land, sea and air, creating a virtual prison in which fundamental human rights are denied. Almost half of households now suffer from food insecurity and only five per cent of water is drinkable. 42 per cent of the population are unemployed and many homes, schools and health facilities are yet to be rebuilt after the 2014 bombing campaign. Israel, as an occupying force, must lift the blockade immediately and comply with international law.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes United Nations resolution 2334 approved in December 2016 reiterating 10 previous resolutions, and reaffirming that Israel\u2019s settlements have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law. However, the Israeli government\u2019s hostility to the resolution simply confirms its longstanding opposition to a viable two state solution.<\/p>\n<p>The resolution commits the United Nations to examine practical ways and means to secure the full implementation of its relevant resolutions. Conference reaffirms its support for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), including a UN arms embargo on Israel and a ban on settlement goods as practical ways of persuading Israel to implement the relevant UN resolutions and end the occupation and the repression of the Palestinian people.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes the UK\u2019s support for the resolution but is concerned by Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s damaging comments downplaying the impact of settlements.

Solidarity with Venezuela","content":"<p>Conference notes the gains made by Venezuela\u2019s progressive government over the last 17 years. Such gains include record investment in public services, creating a free education system and implementing a free national health service. 20 million people have benefited from various anti-poverty missions which have reduced extreme poverty from 20% to 4.8%. Since 2010, the construction of 1.2 million homes has enabled the provision of social and low cost housing for Venezuela\u2019s poorest citizens.<\/p>\n<p>Conference reaffirms its position adopted in 2006 of supporting the progress the Venezuelan government has achieved through using the country\u2019s resources for the benefit of the majority of its people.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further notes Venezuela\u2019s commitment to trade union rights through a progressive labour law. The law has enshrined the right to form unions, trade union freedom, the right to strike and to take secondary and solidarity action; recognised the right to collective bargaining, and an obligation for employers to negotiate with trade unions; ended outsourcing and the use of agency labour to undermine terms and conditions; implemented the right to social security, including pensions, for all workers for the first time; extended maternity and paternity leave; prohibited all forms of discrimination and brought into place an obligation for employers to promote and support employment for disabled workers; established minimum wages\u00a0 and premium payments for shift work by law; defined mass dismissals by law and granted the Labour Ministry power to suspend such dismissals through a set resolution; and granted the right to training and education for all workers.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that Venezuela currently faces a range of political and economic difficulties which seriously threaten social progress in the country. These difficulties have resulted from a global crash in oil prices that has damaged export revenue and the economy.

Jobstown not Guilty \u2013 Defend the right to protest.","content":"<p>In 2016 working people in the Republic of Ireland built a mass campaign of non-payment and direct action to defeat the imposition of a tax on water. This charge was a first step towards the privatisation of water. On 21 October 2016, a 17 year old was found guilty of false imprisonment in the Children&#8217;s Court in the Republic of Ireland. He was 15 at the time of the &#8216;false imprisonment&#8217;, which consisted of participating in a protest against water charges and austerity on 15 November 2014, which resulted in Joan Burton&#8217;s (the then Deputy Prime Minister) car being delayed for two and a half hours in Jobstown in Tallaght in the Republic of Ireland. There was no allegation or charge against him of any violence. He was recognised by the judge as having led a &#8220;blameless life&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, the judge found him guilty of false imprisonment and listed the following factors which led him to that conclusion: He sat in front of a car and encouraged others to do so; He participated in a slow march; He momentarily stood in Joan Burton&#8217;s way and asked to talk to her; He used a megaphone to chant &#8220;No way, we won&#8217;t pay.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is clear that he was protesting, not kidnapping. Although he was given a conditional discharge, meaning that he will not face imprisonment if of good behaviour for nine months, the important fact is that he was found guilty of false imprisonment because of participating in a protest. The verdict prepares the way for convictions and imprisonment of 18 adult defendants next year, and a dramatic broadening of the definition of false imprisonment to include many forms of protest. Striking workers could find their picket lines classed as false imprisonment, as could any protesters who engage in a slow march or sit down protest;<\/li>\n<li>In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a system of law similar to that in the Republic operates. There is a danger that a successful prosecution of the Jobstown defendants could lead to similar tactics being used against protesters here. The first trial of adults starts on April 24 with a group of seven defendants charged with false imprisonment. One of those is Paul Murphy, an MP for the Anti Austerity Alliance. If jailed for more than six months, he will be removed as an MP and the people of Dublin South West (which includes Jobstown) will be denied the democratic choice they made.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Conference resolves to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Condemn the conviction of the 17 year old protester of false imprisonment;<\/li>\n<li>Recognises that &#8220;an injury to one is an injury to all&#8221; and this conviction is a threat to everybody&#8217;s democratic right to protest and to effective trade unionism;<\/li>\n<li>Calls for all charges to be dropped against all the Jobstown protesters immediately.

Exiting the EU - A Fair Deal For Workers and Public Services","content":"<p>Conference notes that the triggering of Article 50 in early 2017 is a decision that affects working people, their families and communities in the UK, in the European Union and broader Europe. The Exiting the EU negotiations require that the government both seeks to leave the EU but also negotiates a new relationship and trade deal with the EU. This is an historic European negotiation that must answer both the challenges of today and tomorrow and fundamentally address devolved UK constitutional and legal issues that also arise.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that these negotiations must be transparent, open to trade union consultation and involve parliamentary scrutiny and accountability. Workers need a fair deal from these negotiations with provisions for investment in quality jobs; protection of livings standards and employment rights; funding for quality public services, regional economies and infrastructure projects; an end to austerity pay levels; a fairer and more equal society and real future opportunities for young people.<\/p>\n<p>Conferences further notes the governments\u2019 introduction of the Great Repeal Bill 2017. The Conservative government has proposed this will be an opportunity to scrutinise, amend, repeal or improve any aspect of EU law in the future. It is imperative that workers\u2019 rights, derived from European Union legislation, are safeguarded and maintained during both EU negotiations and in the future, after the exit date of the UK from the EU. No changes should be made to relevant workers rights legislation except through primary legislation open to full parliamentary scrutiny and trade union consultation.<\/p>\n<p>Conference also believes that an EU deal will only be fair to workers if it does not progressively undermine workers\u2019 rights over time. Therefore any future trade deal between the UK and EU must include a commitment and a mechanism whereby the UK cannot fall behind the EU on improvements to employment rights. To ensure that UK workers rights continue to be no less favourable than EU Worker Rights in the future, UK courts and tribunals must have regard to positive developments in the EU&#8217;s social and employment legislative framework.<\/p>\n<p>Regaining control over the UK economy includes rethinking the use of state aid rules to fund public services and new national infrastructure projects. There is a new opportunity in public procurement to mandate the use of \u2018quality over price\u2019 in awarding private contracts to encourage corporate responsibility, encourage in-house provision, add social value in public services and prevent the race to the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that whilst we have the opportunity to refinance and rebuild our NHS and care services the government has chosen not to. Instead between now and 2022 an estimated \u00a370 billion in a budget \u2018tax give away\u2019 has been given to the very richest and to big business. This is not a fair deal for the public or public services.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further believes that the government must place a fair deal for public services at the core of any new deal with the EU and wider global trade deals. Public services need to be fairly funded, protected and excluded from any new global trade deals and unfair private investment courts. Public services must also be removed from trade deals which encourage a global \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 through de-regulation, little enforcement protections of core ILO conventions and increased privatisation where private operators are allowed to put \u2018global \u2018profits and protection of investments before public interest, local economies and decent pay for workers.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that in the interests of UK workers, public services and the economy the government needs to pursue a new trade deal agreement with the EU which provides the best economic opportunities for the UK to protect living standards and jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Conference notes the free movement of goods, services, capital and workers remains a corner stone of the EU\u2019s Single Market. There can be no access to the Single Market if the right of EU &#8211; workers to seek employment in the UK and vice- versa is no longer guaranteed and is restricted by various controls. A core principle of EU free movement of labour should be that there is equal pay for equal work in the same work place regardless of nationality and it allows for the expansion of collective bargaining.<\/p>\n<p>Conference however reiterates its opposition to all legislation from Europe which allows the exploitation of foreign workers or \u2018posted workers\u2019 and European Court of Justice decisions like Viking, Laval, Ruffert and Luxembourg which put competition and the profit of business before workers rights and which have also been used to attack trade union collective bargaining, the right to strike and workers&#8217; pay and conditions in public procurement.<\/p>\n<p>Conference also believes instead that there must be better regulation of the UK jobs market to ensure every worker has a secure job with secure pay, where workers are treated with equal rights and given decent pay, terms and conditions. Collective bargaining agreements need to be in place in key sectors to stop undercutting, so that workers cannot be undercut by the unscrupulous use of agency workers, zero hour contracts and bogus self-employment.<\/p>\n<p>Conference also agrees that Exiting of the EU must not allow racists and xenophobes to use borders to divide workers. The \u2018right to remain\u2019 for EU workers and freedom of movement must be defended against nationalists and corporate interests who use these issues to play workers against each other. Workers united in solidarity together are stronger in defending and promoting our interests across Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Conference opposes all racists and xenophobe attacks. We stand in solidarity with those facing such hatred and violence in the work place and in our communities. The UK government should guarantee the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK and in particular recognise the valuable contribution that migrant workers make in vital public services such as health and social care. The right of UK workers to remain in the EU should also be part of the fair trade deal between the UK and the EU.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes in a fair deal with the European Union in which peace and cooperation, sustainable growth in all countries, and human and social rights must be preserved. At this moment where European cooperation and integration are threatened, conference is committed to continue to work together with our European sister trade unions, for quality public services, to fight social dumping and pursue a Social Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls on the National Executive Council to campaign for a fair deal for workers and public services and:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to inform and engage UNISON members and the general public on how Exiting the EU negotiations may impact on the four key priority areas set out in the UNISON Exiting the EU campaign:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Employment, health and safety standards and trade union rights;<\/li>\n<li>Public services and professional standards;<\/li>\n<li>Trade deals\/standards, environmental regulations and public procurement;<\/li>\n<li>Freedom of movement and right to remain.

Immigration and the effects of the EU Referendum and the Brexit Vote","content":"<p>The EU Referendum on 23 June 2016 and the decision of the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union sent shock waves through communities with the immigration debate becoming ever more toxic. The campaign itself resulted in unacceptable language and propaganda being used about immigration generating fear, division and a \u2018them and us\u2019 rhetoric.<\/p>\n<p>Since the result was announced there has been a dramatic increase in racial violence across the Country. The number of hate crimes recorded for the last two weeks in June 2016 spiked by 42 per cent on the previous year. The biggest number of recorded incidents came on 24 June \u2013 the day after the result \u2013 when there were 289 hate crime related incidents recorded.<\/p>\n<p>With Scotland and Northern Ireland voting to remain and England and Wales voting to leave, the split has left Great Britain divided. The main political parties at this time are in disarray and there is a lack of political leadership. After years of austerity the electorate has shown a mood for change.<\/p>\n<p>With the Conservative Party electing Theresa May as Prime Minister and the new evolved Brexit department, the sense of the unknown is still very much at the top of the political agenda. With the Labour Party\u2019s internal turmoil, it will be up to the trade unions to bring some stability and clear vision.<\/p>\n<p>Within the Black community we have to reflect and recognise that many within our community used their democratic right to vote to leave the EU which appeared to help fuel this meltdown of the political elite and had a significant breakdown within many families and communities.<\/p>\n<p>The Labour Party, once the party of the working class and the poor, founded in Bradford where once the sounds of the machinery of the cotton mills could be heard, the poorest and the youngest of our nation applying their trade and the migrants that were immigrants from the Asian, West Indian and African Continents continued the profitable industry of that time, did not get their message to remain across to many of those communities<\/p>\n<p>Soon after the result was announced UNISON called for unity and committed to hold the Leave campaign to their promises, more money for the NHS, rights at work remaining intact and continuing to defend and protect workers and public services.<\/p>\n<p>As discussions regarding the UK\u2019s future relationship with Europe get underway, Black workers face a period of instability at home and at work. Our union has a role to play not just in continuing the fight for equality but in providing stability, unity and support to Black, and all workers.<\/p>\n<p>The EU has been active in a number of human rights protections including employment and Anti-Discrimination law. Many of these protections, particularly those around anti-discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability and age, have been incorporated into UK law by the Equality Act 2010. However Brexit will mean the EU law basis of these rights will disappear. This will not change the Equality Act or other UK legislation however if Parliament wanted to weaken such rights Brexit makes it much easier to do so given EU minimum standards of protection would no longer provide a backstop to any changes.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, whilst many of the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) find their way into UK law through the UK Human Rights Act (and not EU law) the protection of these rights may be subject to change arising out of any Government plans to consult on repealing the Human Rights Act and replacing it with a British Bill of Rights. Something that has been regularly threatened by the Conservative Government in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>As we face a future outside the EU we must be vigilant against any attempt to weaken our human rights or equality legislation going forward. As Black members we have long campaigned for equality &#8211; in this political climate the challenges may be increasing but our determination is greater still.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes the hard Brexit pushed by UKIP and the right-wing of the Tory Party would be an unmitigated disaster leading to job losses, price hikes and hitting those who can least afford it hardest.

The EU has played a key role in protecting workers from exploitation, inequality, hazards and discrimination, and in promoting good employment practices. The referendum result does make Brexit a reality and that democratic decision must be respected, however the trade union movement must now ensure that the Government does not use leaving Europe as an opportunity for deliver a bonfire of those established employment and equality rights.<\/p>\n<p>It has become clear the Tories\u2019 vision for Brexit is of the UK acting as a low-tax, low-regulation haven for unscrupulous businesses.\u00a0 With no concrete plan for creating a stable economy &#8211; or how our public services will be properly funded &#8211; the need for stability and reassurance for working people has never been greater. Hard-working public sector workers from Europe who came to the UK to work for our NHS, schools and social care, must also be reassured they are welcome and can remain.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that employment rights must be protected in full and that any plan for Brexit must include a provision for investment in quality jobs and the protection of living standards. Furthermore, any trade deal with the EU and other major economies must include a fair deal for public services, rather than the threat of further privatisation represented in the now stalled Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations.<\/p>\n<p>The North East is set to lose the most in terms of funding as a result of Brexit, having received \u00a3195.4 million in European Social Fund grants and \u00a3296.0 million in European Regional Development Fund grants.

It is an international peace treaty co-signed by the UK Government and the Irish Government and registered with the United Nations. European Community law, its conventions and charters and access both to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights are explicit in the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998.<\/p>\n<p>The desire to protect our precarious peace process was a major feature of the successful trade union campaign, led by UNISON Northern Ireland, which resulted in a majority vote to \u2018remain\u2019 in Northern Ireland. The desire of the UK Government to pursue a \u2018hard\u2019 exit from the EU is a major threat to the principles of consent and equivalence of rights across the island of Ireland that are core principles of the peace process.

Standing together for LGBT equality","content":"<p>Conference believes UNISON\u2019s championing of public services and public service values has never been more important. Conservative government austerity cuts have left public services reeling, struggling to meet ever rising demand from services users. Service user needs become greater and more complex as they struggle with financial insecurity due to stagnant or falling wages, redundancy and welfare cuts, insecurity and fears for the future. Yet the Conservative government bulldozes ahead with its anti-public service, anti-worker, anti-trade union propaganda, presenting our hard won safety net of workers\u2019 rights and human rights as bureaucratic red tape, to be cut away.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further believes that the voice and validation given to division and scapegoating in campaigning around the European Union (EU) referendum continue to distort public debate. Referendum campaigning paid scant attention to the actual impact of EU membership, with much focus on Black communities and faith groups, and on migrant workers from outside the EU. It fed the fears of disenfranchised and disadvantaged communities. Conference condemns the racism, xenophobia and anti-immigrant tone evident in much campaigning; conference expresses concern about the clear damage to community relations and individual safety and to values of solidarity and equality.<\/p>\n<p>With the public service equality agenda increasingly pushed to the side, Conference is further concerned that minority public services which never had popular appeal are at risk of disappearing altogether. Authoritative research carried out for UNISON in 2013 found:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>LGBT people were facing greater financial hardship, problems finding safe accommodation and increased marginalisation and invisibility;<\/li>\n<li>A reduction of specialised LGBT services, including housing support and homelessness services, anti-hate crime and youth services, support and help-line services, mental health and sexual health services, and gender identity services, at exactly the time these services were more needed than ever;<\/li>\n<li>A fear that progress on challenging anti-LGBT discrimination was being reversed and that homophobia, biphobia and transphobia were on the rise again;<\/li>\n<li>LGBT concerns and needs are treated as less important: a \u2018nice thing to do\u2019 that could be dropped in harder times;<\/li>\n<li>A loss of valuable LGBT staff and staff with specialist knowledge that was difficult to replace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Conference welcomes further research carried out in 2016 to update these findings.

Race Inequality in the Workplace","content":"<p>Conference notes that despite efforts to bring further equality into society, evidence shows that Black workers are still being held back in the job market. The amount of Black members holding senior posts still remains low while unemployment amongst Black people remains high, particularly amongst young Black people, and Black workers are also more likely to be in less secure forms of employment than white workers.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent report published by the Equality and Human Rights Commission titled, \u2018Healing a divided Britain: the need for a comprehensive race equality strategy\u2019, it is stated that a failure to tackle deep-rooted race inequality will exacerbate division in our society unless urgent action is taken. Hailed as the biggest ever review into race equality, the 73 page report looks at a number of aspects of everyday life including education, employment, housing, pay and living standards, health, criminal justice, and participation.<\/p>\n<p>For our union it is vital that we support our members both in and outside of the workplace, and how we respond to tackling widespread inequality must remain a priority.<\/p>\n<p>In workplaces that inequality is still prevalent, Black workers with degrees earn 23.1% less on average than white workers, and a significantly lower percentage of Black members (8.8%) work as managers, directors and senior officers. Black workers are also in insecure forms of employment such as temporary contracts or working for an agency, this has increased in the last five years by nearly 40% compared with a 16% rise for white workers.<\/p>\n<p>Unemployment is also a huge challenge. The unemployment rate amongst Black people is at 12.9%, and for young Black people in particular there has been a significant increase in unemployment. Apprenticeship opportunities are significantly lower for Black people, and Black men and women experienced some of the largest falls in full-time employment since the recession began and as the austerity programme continues.<\/p>\n<p>It is sometimes difficult in workplaces for Black members to feel able to challenge this ongoing inequality. As cuts continue across all sectors some members have advised that they will not challenge or seek recourse if they feel they have been passed over for promotion. In addition, as there is now no legal requirement to carry out an Equality Impact Needs Assessment when cutting services, being able to challenge where and why cuts are made and the impact these have on Black workers can often feel overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>Conference notes that branches and regions continue to challenge employers when cuts are proposed; however, it is clear that inequality exists in many walks of life, particularly in employment.

Challenging Racism and Xenophobia","content":"<p>Conference is deeply alarmed at the rise in visible, expressed racism over the past year. Across the UK, racist attacks on Black communities and those perceived to be of migrant backgrounds rose dramatically in the aftermath of the EU referendum result. This legitimisation of public displays of prejudice has led to UNISON\u2019s migrant worker members working in public services finding themselves on the sharp end of a toxic public debate, heightened by the election of US President Donald Trump. It has also highlighted the continued vulnerability of the UK\u2019s settled and long-established Black communities to racist attacks.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes this has been decades in the making, with scaremongering and demonization of immigrants accompanied by legislative attacks on migrant communities, affecting their ability to access public services, private housing and banking accounts. A new crime of illegal working makes migrant workers more vulnerable than ever before. It will allow immigration officials wide ranging powers to seize property, to seize earnings, to close down businesses, to enter and search properties. This could lead to a twelve month prison sentence with an unlimited fine for anyone found working without the right papers &#8211; grossly disproportionate and likely to make undocumented migrant workers even more vulnerable to exploitative employers.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes the leadership and activism shown by our migrant worker networks for EU migrant workers, African migrant workers and Filipino migrant workers who ensure that UNISON\u2019s work is led by their voices and experiences. Conference also welcomes national resources developed to support the work of branches and activists in challenging racism and xenophobia and believes this should be built upon and extended in the coming year.<\/p>\n<p>Conference fears that the UK exit from the EU will be used as an excuse for yet more attacks on migrant workers as well as the removal of workplace rights regarded as \u2018red-tape\u2019. This will exacerbate the UK\u2019s economic problems, leave public services still reeling from austerity, divide our communities and lead to a race to the bottom at work.<\/p>\n<p>Conference welcomes the continuing work by branches, activists and self organised groups to challenge racism in the workplace but believes that this needs to be strengthened in the years ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Trade unions have a unique capacity to bring together workers from all races and communities to tackle the fundamental causes of division and anxiety: better pay and job security, better public services, a fairer labour market and a country that serves all its people, not the few. Whether it is the Tory Party\u2019s claim to be the \u2018worker\u2019s party\u2019 or UKIP\u2019s attempts to scaremonger and divide our community, we as trade unionists have a duty to challenge them. This is a challenge that UNISON has always met, and will do so again.<\/p>\n<p>Conference asserts that the only real answer to low pay and exploitation for all workers is stronger employment rights protections, stronger collective bargaining and trade union solidarity against racism. Conference further asserts that the trade union movement must stand at the forefront of tackling racism in the workplace and in our communities.<\/p>\n<p>Conference therefore calls upon the National Executive Council to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A renewed focus on collective bargaining and trade union activity to challenge racism in the workplace and beyond;<\/li>\n<li>Resist attempts by the Government to strip away employment protections at work;<\/li>\n<li>Work with UNISON\u2019s self organised groups and migrant worker networks to counter discrimination and attacks on migrant workers at national and workplace level;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to support the TUC\u2019s march to mark UN anti-racism day;<\/li>\n<li>Continue to develop, promote and implement training materials and resources in conjunction with self organised groups and branches to challenge discrimination and prejudice;<\/li>\n<li>Work with a wide coalition of anti-racist groups at national and local level to support local community organising against all manifestations of racism, anti-semitism and xenophobia, including branches affiliating and working with HOPE not hate, Show Racism the Red Card, Stand up to Racism and Unite Against Fascism;<\/li>\n<li>Work with groups such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, the Migrant Rights Network, Refugee Action and the Refugee Council to advocate for a rights based approach to migrant workers and challenge discriminatory treatment of vulnerable people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>National Executive Council<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>87.1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After existing third paragraph, insert new paragraph:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cConference recognises that the attacks on Black communities and migrant workers include the commission of criminal offences which amount to hate crimes.

NHS Car Parking Costs","content":"<p>The exorbitant cost of car parking at hospitals and GP\u2019s surgeries is putting an increasing financial burden on patients and carers especially women who are the main carers for elderly family and children attending GP surgeries and hospital for routine and regular appointments. For more serious ailments and long term stays in hospital, the cost become so expensive that it starts to place additional pressures on women and families.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2015, the BBC found that hospitals were making millions of pounds every year from car parking charges and that most hospitals charge for disabled parking. These costs are also higher or lower depending where you live. The cost to carers living in the South East of England will usually be higher costs than most other regions (but not all). Hospital car parking charges in Scotland and Wales were abolished in 2008 but not in England. Although car parking\u00a0 charges still exist in Northern Ireland, patients receiving radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment, patients receiving renal dialysis and next of kin visiting patients in critical care or a high dependency unit are eligible for free car parking.<\/p>\n<p>Charities such as MacMillan Cancer and groups such as the Patients Association have said that hospital car parking charges are morally wrong especially for disabled patients and patients who have to attend hospital for life saving treatment, for example radiotherapy. The Patients Association also state that the claim from hospitals that car parking revenue is reinvested back into patient care and front line services is simply not true.<\/p>\n<p>The economic value of the contributions made by carers in the UK is \u00a3132 billion a year. The majority of carers are women who are fed up with the government making money from their unpaid labour and even more angry that they actually have to pay (via charges such as hospital car park costs) to carry out that caring role. Conference believes that NHS England can do more to ensure that patients, especially the disabled and women carers are not made to pay what amounts to a financial penalty.<\/p>\n<p>Conference believes that the Government should take action to limit this financial burden on patients and carers. Conference calls on the National Executive Council to work with Labour Link, National Self-Organised Groups, Young Members and other committees and department and external agencies as necessary to develop a national campaign and lobby government for a review and cessation of car parking charges at hospitals in England and asking the government to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek to abolish all car parking charges in hospitals in England as has been achieved in both Scotland and Wales;<\/li>\n<li>Seek, as a minimum, to move to a model similar to that in Northern Ireland whereby car parking charges are kept at a minimum and which are free to patients attending hospital for life saving treatment and for next of kin and family visitors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Isle of Wight LG<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Waverley Unison<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT WITH QUALIFICATIONS<\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":"7047","type":"about-section","title":"98.

Fees are now generally in excess of \u00a39,000 and universities are forced to develop marketing strategies to compete for students, who are seen as customers buying degrees as a product;<\/li>\n<li>Introducing competition into higher education has been and continues to be a disaster for students, education workers and all working people, irrespective of their involvement in university life. Whilst many public services delivered by local authorities and the NHS are being relentlessly starved of funds, the elaborate system of student loans for fees is a con trick designed to fiddle the national debt and ultimately extract profits from future generations of graduates, as if young people do not have enough to worry about;<\/li>\n<li>The speed of change is forcing vice-chancellors to turn their institutions into businesses, with the inevitable impact on jobs, terms and conditions of our members.

No one really knows how many women actually died, but one estimate is that 15% of all maternal deaths were a result of botched backstreet abortions.<\/p>\n<p>The 1967 Abortion Act gave women limited access to safe abortions, but that right has had to be defended many times since 1967 and our Trade Union movement has always been central to that defence. We recognised abortion is a class issue. Rich women always have the money to access safe abortions; it was largely working class women who died in the back streets and who suffer disproportionally when abortion is restricted.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further notes that the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland and that a woman was recently sentenced to prison (sentence suspended) for using the abortion pill purchased over the internet due to non-availability in Northern Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>Women in Poland took to the streets in huge numbers to prevent the total banning of abortion in their country organising a \u2018women\u2019s strike\u2019 that tens of thousands took part in.<\/p>\n<p>The fight for a women\u2019s right to choose is a global fight.<\/p>\n<p>Conference further notes that the Abortions Rights Campaign UK will be actively celebrating the 50th anniversary and using the event to raise the profile of the abortion rights movement and campaign to extend the right to abortion beyond the 1967 Act.<\/p>\n<p>Conference calls on all relevant national bodies to encourage our members in branches across the union to hold events to promote the 50th anniversary and to raise the profile of the Abortion Rights Campaign in UK in any way that they can to this end.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Greater London Region<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>NEC POLICY: SUPPORT<\/em><\/p>\n"}]},{"id":"5948ba7970b37","name":"Overview","type":"feature-about","icon":"22","sorting":"manual","sections":[{"id":"600","type":"about-section","title":"Welcome","content":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-602\" src=\"https:\/\/ndc2017.unison.org.uk\/content\/uploads\/sites\/43\/2017\/06\/utLVYsg2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"http:\/\/ndc2017.unison.org.uk\/content\/uploads\/sites\/43\/2017\/06\/utLVYsg2.jpg 512w, http:\/\/ndc2017.unison.org.uk\/content\/uploads\/sites\/43\/2017\/06\/utLVYsg2-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/ndc2017.unison.org.uk\/content\/uploads\/sites\/43\/2017\/06\/utLVYsg2-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A very warm welcome to everyone attending UNISON\u2019s National Delegate Conference, especially those for whom this is the first time.<\/p>\n<p>In this app you should find everything you need to follow conference proceedings and details about the Brighton Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Best wishes for a good conference!<\/p>\n<p>Dave Prentis<br \/>\nGeneral Secretary<\/p>\n"},{"id":"568","type":"about-section","title":"No smoking","content":"<p>A no smoking policy exists within the Brighton centre.
